# Teams
**Collaborate on your app in real time with teammates**

CodinIT lets you build apps together, live. Invite your designer, developer, agency, or anyone else to your workspace. Everyone sees changes as they happen.

Each subscription is now connected to a workspace:

- **Users with a Pro subscription** have personal workspaces. You can still invite up to 2 people to individual projects. Collaborators on a project use project owner credits.
- **Users with a Teams subscription** can have up to 20 users in their workspace. Owners & admins can freely invite & remove users and manage projects. Editors can only make edits to existing projects. All users in a workspace share the connected credit pool.

More info on pricing **here**.
