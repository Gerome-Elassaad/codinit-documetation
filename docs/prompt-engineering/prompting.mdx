**Prompt structure, levels of prompting, meta/reverse meta prompting, and foundational tactics with examples**

## Heads up!

To help you make the most out of CodinIT, we compiled a list of prompting strategies and approaches. Some of these were collected from our team's experience, and others were shared with us by our community members. Since CodinIT relies on large language models (LLMs), effective prompting strategies can significantly improve its efficiency and accuracy.

## What is Prompting?

Prompting refers to the textual instructions you give an AI system to perform a task. In CodinIT (an AI-powered app builder), prompts are how you "tell" the AI what to do – from creating a UI to writing backend logic. Effective prompting is critical because CodinIT uses large language models (LLMs), so clear, well-crafted prompts can greatly improve the AI's efficiency and accuracy in building your app. In short, **better prompts lead to better results**.

## Why Prompting Matters

Most people think prompting is just typing a request into an AI and hoping for the best – not so. The difference between a mediocre AI response and having AI build entire workflows for you comes down to how you prompt. Whether you're a developer or non-technical, mastering prompt engineering in CodinIT can help you:

- **Automate repetitive tasks** by instructing the AI precisely what to do
- **Debug faster** with AI-generated insights and solutions
- **Build and optimize workflows** effortlessly, letting AI handle the heavy lifting once properly guided

And the best part? You don't need to be an expert programmer. With the right prompting techniques, you can unlock AI's full potential in CodinIT without wasted trial-and-error.

## Understanding How AI Thinks

Unlike traditional coding, working with AI is about communicating your intentions clearly. Large Language Models (LLMs) like the ones powering CodinIT don't "understand" in a human sense – they predict outputs based on patterns in their training data.

### Key AI Communication Principles

- **Provide Context and Details**: AI models have no common sense or implicit context beyond what you give them. Always supply relevant background or requirements.
- **Be Explicit with Instructions**: Never assume the AI will infer your goals. If you have constraints or preferences, state them clearly.
- **Structure Matters**: Models pay special attention to the beginning and end of your prompt. Put crucial details at the start.
- **Know the Model's Limits**: The AI's knowledge comes from training data and can't know about recent events or proprietary info you haven't provided.

## Core Prompting Principles: The C.L.E.A.R. Framework

Great prompts follow a set of simple principles. Use **C.L.E.A.R.** as a checklist when crafting your instructions:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>C - Concise</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      <div>
        Be clear and get to the point. Extra fluff or vague language can confuse the model.
        <ul>
          <li>**BAD**: "Could you maybe write something about a science topic?"</li>
          <li>**GOOD**: "Write a 200-word summary of the effects of climate change on coastal cities."</li>
        </ul>
        <details className="faq-dropdown">

## The Four Levels of Prompting

Effective prompting is a skill that grows with practice. Here are four levels of prompting mastery:

### Level 1: Structured "Training Wheels" Prompting

When starting or tackling complex tasks, use a labeled structure in your prompt:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Context</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      <div>
        Background or role setup for the AI.
        <br />**Example**: "You are a world-class CodinIT AI coding assistant."
      </div>
    </StepContent>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Task</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      <div>
        The specific goal you want to achieve.
        <br />**Example**: "Build a full-stack to-do list app with user login and real-time sync."
      </div>
    </StepContent>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Guidelines</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      <div>
        Preferred approach or style.
        <br />**Example**: "Use React for frontend, Tailwind for styling, and Supabase for auth and database."
      </div>
    </StepContent>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Constraints</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      <div>
        Hard limits or must-not-dos.
        <br />**Example**: "Do not use any paid APIs. The app should work on mobile and desktop."
        <details className="faq-dropdown">
          <summary>When should I move beyond structured prompting?</summary>
          <div className="faq-content">
            <p>Placeholder: Indicators for advancing to more conversational prompting styles and skill progression markers will be detailed here.</p>
          </div>
        </details>
      </div>
    </StepContent>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Level 2: Conversational Prompting

As you get comfortable, write to the AI more naturally, like explaining a task to a colleague:

```
Let's build a feature to upload a profile picture. It should include a form with an image file input and a submit button. When submitted, it should store the image in Supabase storage and update the user profile. Please write the necessary React component and any backend function needed for this, and ensure to handle errors (like file too large) gracefully.
```

<summary>How do I maintain clarity in conversational prompts?</summary>
<div className="faq-content">
<p>Placeholder: Techniques for keeping conversational prompts focused, clear, and comprehensive will be provided here.</p>
</div>
</details>

### Level 3: Meta Prompting (AI-Assisted Prompt Improvement)

Ask the AI to help improve your prompts:

- "Review my last prompt and identify any ambiguity or missing info. How can I rewrite it to be more concise and precise?"
- "Rewrite this prompt to be more specific and detailed: 'Create a secure login page in React using Supabase.'"

<summary>What are the best practices for meta prompting?</summary>
<div className="faq-content">
<p>Placeholder: Advanced meta prompting techniques, collaboration strategies with AI, and prompt optimization workflows will be covered here.</p>
</div>
</details>

### Level 4: Reverse Meta Prompting (AI as Documentation Tool)

Use the AI to summarize and document what happened for future reference:

```
Summarize the errors we encountered setting up JWT authentication and explain how we resolved them. Then, draft a prompt I could use in the future to avoid those mistakes when setting up auth.
```

<details className="faq-dropdown">
<summary>How do I use reverse meta prompting for knowledge building?</summary>
<div className="faq-content">
<p>Placeholder: Strategies for building institutional knowledge, creating documentation, and learning from AI interactions will be detailed here.</p>
</div>
</details>

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Prompting

**Zero-Shot Prompting**: Ask the model to perform a task with no examples.
```
Translate the following sentence to Spanish: 'I am learning to code.'
```

**Few-Shot Prompting**: Provide examples to show the AI exactly what you want.
```
Correct the grammar in these sentences:
Input: "the code not working good" → Output: "The code is not working well."
Input: "API give error in login" → Output: "The API gives an error during login."
Now Input: "user not found in database" → Output:
```

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Step 1: Foundation</StepTitle>
    <StepContent>
      <div>
        "Set up a Supabase-connected CRM backend."
      </div>
    </StepContent>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <StepTitle>Step 2: Authentication</StepTitle>

          </div>
        </details>
      </div>
    </StepContent>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Use CodinIT's Modes Intentionally

- **Chat Mode**: Use for planning, brainstorming, and debugging without modifying code
- **Default Mode**: Use for implementing changes and writing code

**Example workflow**:
1. In Chat Mode: "I want to add a blog section to my app. Let's discuss how to structure the data and pages."
2. In Default Mode: "Create a BlogPost page and a Supabase table for blog posts based on the above plan."

<details className="faq-dropdown">
<summary>What are the advantages of each mode?</summary>
<div className="faq-content">
<p>Placeholder: Detailed comparison of Chat vs Default modes, use case scenarios, and mode switching strategies will be covered here.</p>
</div>
</details>

### Include Constraints and Requirements

Always spell out constraints clearly:

```
Create a simple to-do app with a maximum of 3 tasks visible at a time.
Include the ability to add, edit, and delete tasks.

Optimize this code, but ensure the UI and core functionality remain unchanged. Document each change you make.

Use at most 3 API calls for this, and ensure no external library is required.
```

### Use Image Prompts Effectively

CodinIT allows image uploads with prompts:

**Simple approach**:
```
Create and implement a UI that looks as similar as possible to the image attached.
```

**Detailed approach**:
```
I want you to create the app as similar as possible to the one shown in this screenshot.
It's essentially a kanban clone.
It should have the ability to add new cards (tickets) in each column, have the ability to change the order of those tickets within a single column, and even move those cards between columns.
Feel free to use the React DnD npm package for drag-and-drop functionality.
```

<summary>What makes an effective image prompt?</summary>
<div className="faq-content">
<p>Placeholder: Image prompt best practices, visual communication strategies, and image preparation guidelines will be detailed here.</p>
</div>
</details>

## Advanced Tips and Techniques

### Provide Precise Edit Instructions

Focus the AI on specific components:
```
In the Header component, change the signup button's text to 'Get Started' and move it to the left side of the nav bar.
```

Add constraints:
```
Do not modify any other components or logic unrelated to the header.
```

### Design and UI Tweaks

For visual changes:
```
Make the login button blue and 20% larger, but do not alter any of its functionality or onClick logic.
```

For responsiveness:
```
Optimize the landing page for mobile: use a mobile-first approach. Start by outlining how each section should rearrange on smaller screens, then implement those CSS changes using standard Tailwind breakpoints.
```

- Complex logic and multi-step operations
- Boilerplate generation
- Things you're unsure about
- New feature implementation from scratch

**Don't use AI for**:
- Extremely small changes (changing a text label, adjusting padding)
- Simple fixes you can do quickly manually
- When it might use up your prompt quota unnecessarily
